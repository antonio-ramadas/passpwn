passpwn - password breach checker
================

Fork changes:
 - Passwords captured on standard input
 - Use of ```shasum``` instaed of ```sha1sum```
 - Tested only on macOS

================

This is a tool for checking your passwords in [pass](https://www.passwordstore.org/) against [Have I been pwned?](https://haveibeenpwned.com/).

passpwn uses the range API which means that we are only sending the first 5
characters of a SHA1 hashed password to Have I been pwned? and are checking
the returned hashes against the full local hash.

Inspiration for this tool comes from the [1Password
blog](https://blog.agilebits.com/2018/02/22/finding-pwned-passwords-with-1password/).

A big thanks to haveibeenpwned.com for making this possible in a secure way.
